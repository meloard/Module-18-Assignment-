# Social Network - NOSQL

## Description

In this challenge we worked with MongoDB (NOSQL) to create the back-end for a basic social network app. Once the server.js was built, we biult both thought and user routes to gather each sets of data, testing our CRUD routes with insomnia. While I encountered some challenges in this assignment with getting the server running, I gained a better understanding of mongodb and the syntax associated with it.
